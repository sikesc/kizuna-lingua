# 💞 KizunaLingua

Kizuna Lingua is a partner-based language learning app designed for couples or friends studying each other’s languages. Users create shared challenges, write journals, exchange feedback, and practice speaking through real-time recorded conversation tasks. The app automatically adjusts difficulty for each partner, keeps track of progress, and connects writing, speaking, and grammar into one consistent learning flow. It turns language study into a shared, motivating, and relationship-strengthening experience.
